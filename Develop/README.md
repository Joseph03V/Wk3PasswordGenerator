# My WebDev Portfolio

## Functionality
This program was written for users to create more and safer passwords. The password is based on the
users chosen characters, and also based on how long the user request it to be. I used confirm
promps to gain the users criteria for the password. The password is gained by using a math.random
method on a string of the users chosen characters.

## Improvements
Improvements I could implement is adding a copy button so that the user can put the password into 
their clipboard. I could put it right next to or under the generate button. I also would like to add
a feature that lets the user download the password as maybe a text file. So that they have easier 
access to it rather than a one time copy. I could also maybe turn the prompts into a form. 

## Challenges I faced
The challenge I faced was trying to do multiple prompts in a row. In the beginning  only the first 
confirm prompt was showing, but with further research I found out how to do them in a sequential order

## What did I learn
I learned how to give multiple confirm prompts to the user, and I also learned how to use 
the math.random method to generate a string of random characters from an even longer string.
